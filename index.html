                You might saw me jumping, climbing or doing nothing on the street. But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the WebDeveloper.

                If i get myself comfortable in the field of software development, I’ll definitely stumble upon the blog of David Walsh. I’ll find great articles about CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and much more. Make sure to check out his web development blog if you get to know about web development.

                    If I have that kind of a curious mind about coding and loads of questions such as what the hell is web development? or what is back-end.Am I a noob in all the fields of CS and want fast results with less studying? I was the same a few months ago and honestly, the beginning. But I'm learning everyday.
